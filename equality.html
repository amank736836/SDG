              <p>
                Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and
                sustainable world.
                
                There has been progress over the last decades: More girls are going to school, fewer girls are forced into early
                marriage, more women are serving in parliament and positions of leadership, and laws are being reformed to advance
                gender equality.
                
                Despite these gains, many challenges remain: discriminatory laws and social norms remain pervasive, women continue to be
                underrepresented at all levels of political leadership, and 1 in 5 women and girls between the ages of 15 and 49 report
                experiencing physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner within a 12-month period.
                
                The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could reverse the limited progress that has been made on gender equality and
                women’s rights. The coronavirus outbreak exacerbates existing inequalities for women and girls across every sphere –
                from health and the economy, to security and social protection.
                
                Women play a disproportionate role in responding to the virus, including as frontline healthcare workers and carers at
                home. Women’s unpaid care work has increased significantly as a result of school closures and the increased needs of
                older people. Women are also harder hit by the economic impacts of COVID-19, as they disproportionately work in insecure
                labour markets. Nearly 60 per cent of women work in the informal economy, which puts them at greater risk of falling
                into poverty.
                
                The pandemic has also led to a steep increase in violence against women and girls. With lockdown measures in place, many
                women are trapped at home with their abusers, struggling to access services that are suffering from cuts and
                restrictions. Emerging data shows that, since the outbreak of the pandemic, violence against women and girls – and
                particularly domestic violence – has intensified.
